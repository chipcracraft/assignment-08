### Status
-------------
> **2 / 4**

<mark>**Incomplete</mark> :** *Approaching expectations for assignment.*


### Instructor Evaluation
--------------
site is not taking up full-width of page and missing crucial styling and positioning
requirements.

good job w/ creating double footer (one for mobile one for tablet)

To pass this assignment:
- make the site extend the full width of the screen (with inner content containing a max-witdht) ,
- fix the nav bar
- and fix .second-string element so that the text is readable
